# Rigden's Awesome Cryptocurrency List 
> This is a collection of the most awesome<sup>[*](#disclaimer)</sup> links about cryptocurrency on the internet. Why does the world need yet another blockchain and cyrptocurrency list? Because all the other list are currently unmaintained. Most have not been updated in four to six months. This is an eternity in such a fast moving industry.  [Jason Rigden](https://twitter.com/mr_rigden) manages and updates this awesome list weekly.

Despite what you may have heard elsewhere on the internet, a thing's level of inherent awesomeness is completely subjective. This project will use the subjective perspective of Jason Rigden. He will serve as this list's arbiter of awesome. Readers of this list may find themselves in disagreement with Mr. Rigden. This is to be expected and is a natural by product of this process. Turn off the computer, go outside, and your symptoms should disappear in a few hours. If symptoms continue to persist, contact a mental heath care professional immediately. You may be suffering from an unrelated but serious personality disorder.
